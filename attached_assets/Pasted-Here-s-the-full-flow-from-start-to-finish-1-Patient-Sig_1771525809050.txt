Here's the full flow from start to finish:

1. Patient Signs Up
The patient creates an account on the platform (email/password or Google sign-in). They're automatically assigned as a Level 1 (Applicant) user.

2. Patient Browses Packages
They visit the packages/services page and pick the service they need (e.g., an ESA letter, support animal certification, etc.). Each package has its own price, required documents, and form fields.

3. Patient Completes Payment
After selecting a package, they go through payment. Once paid, their application is created with the status "pending".

4. Application Sits in Admin Queue
The application now shows up in the Admin's (Level 3) "All Orders" list with a "Pending" badge. It's waiting for an admin to take action.

5. Admin Sends Application to a Doctor
The admin clicks the "Send to Doctor" button on that application. Behind the scenes:

The system automatically picks the next doctor in line using a fair rotation (round-robin -- like a draft system, so no single doctor gets overloaded).
A secure one-time-use link is generated (a long random code that expires in 7 days).
The application status changes to "doctor_review".
The admin sees a popup with the secure review link they can copy and email/text to the doctor.
6. Doctor Reviews via Secure Link
The doctor opens the link in any browser -- no login or account needed. They see:

Patient's name, email, phone, date of birth, address
The service package details
Any form data the patient filled out
Their own name and credentials displayed for confirmation
7. Doctor Makes a Decision
At the bottom of the review page, the doctor can add optional notes and then click either:

"Approve Application" -- or --
"Deny Application"
The link can only be used once. After they decide, it's done.

8a. If Approved:

Application status changes to "doctor_approved"
A certificate/document is automatically generated with the doctor's credentials (name, license number, NPI, DEA)
The patient gets a notification that their application was approved and documents are being prepared
Auto-messages fire if configured for this package
8b. If Denied:

Application status changes to "doctor_denied"
The patient gets a notification with the denial reason (if the doctor provided notes)
Auto-messages fire if configured
9. Completion
Once approved, the patient can access their auto-generated certificate/documents from their dashboard. The admin can optionally mark the application as "completed" for final closure.

The doctor can see their full review history (approved, denied, pending counts) on their own dashboard, along with any commissions they've earned from referrals.
